Monty Hall Problem
==========

Overview
--------
This project is meant to replicate the Monty Hall Problem. Behind three doors, there are 
two goats and one car. First, the user is asked to choose a door. The program then reveals
a door with a goat behind it. Then, the user is asked if he/she would like to switch doors. 
The program then reveals what is behind the user's door. Hint: User should probably switch. 



Here is an example of how the code should run in CommandPrompt/Terminal:
<pre>
Choose a door between 1-3:
2
There is a goat behind door number 1
Would you like to switch your door? (Yes or No):
yes
Your new door number is 3
CONGRATS! behind door # 3 is a car
  ______
 ll_ll_\`.__
(   _    _ _\
=`-(_)--(_)-'

</pre>
